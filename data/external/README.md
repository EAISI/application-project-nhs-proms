Data is downloaded from the [NHS Digital PROMs portal](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/patient-reported-outcome-measures-proms). Each year has a separate entry and runs from April to April. We use the following finalized CSV data packs:
- [2018 - 2019](https://files.digital.nhs.uk/52/A8FF7F/PROMs%20CSV%20Data%20Pack%20Finalised%202018-19.zip)
- [2017 - 2018](https://files.digital.nhs.uk/70/5176AA/CSV%20Data%20Pack%20Final%201718.zip)
- [2016 - 2017](https://files.digital.nhs.uk/6C/A1D581/CSV%20Data%20Pack%202016-17%20Finalised.zip)

As the filenames are not uniform for the different data packs, each file has been included separately in this repository for convenience.
