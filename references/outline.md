# NHS PROMs data science case study for hip and knee replacement
We use the CRISP-DM model, where each lessons covers sections of the whole process. For example, chapter 2 on Data Understanding has separate lessons for each sub-step:

  1. Collect initial data: download and combine the data
  2. Describe the data: how many observations, unique values etc.?
  3. Explore the data: how does it look like, do you see anything odd c.q. interesting?
  4. Verify data quality

## 5-day curriculum
This case study was developed with a 5-day curriculum in mind.

## Bibliography and online course material
There is a lot of excellent data science and Python material out there. Our own favourites are:
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ by Aurélien Géron. A [series of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) is freely available, some of which have been re-used in this case study.
* [Real Python's tutorials on data science](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/), of which a selection of tutorials are tied in to specific lessons.
