# NHS PROMs case study for hip and knee replacement
We use the CRISP-DM model, where each lessons covers sections of the whole process. For example, chapter 2 on Data Understanding has separate lessons for each sub-step:

  1. Collect initial data: download and combine the data
  2. Describe the data: how many observations, unique values etc.?
  3. Explore the data: how does it look like, do you see anything odd c.q. interesting?
  4. Verify data quality
